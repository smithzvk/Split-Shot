  Moved the journal over to the readme file as this will make it display by
  default on a GitHub page, which is nice.

  Spent the day mostly spending time with my family, making dinner, and baking
  challah for Easter.

  Was stuck for some time on how to receive input events.  I knew that it wasn't
  associating them with the game class, but I didn't know how to set up that
  association.  The key is to use the ~post-initialize~ method to hold those
  bindings.

  Note that this engine (like many, but not all) doesn't respect keyboard
  layouts.  You need to define your key bindings as if you are using a QWERTY
  layout.  That is fine by me... it makes it easier to not need to support
  multiple layouts in game, however it can be a bit confusing for the user.

  Started this log.

  Been futzing with Emacs stuff for about an hour.  I don't get to hack at home
  very much and thus it seems that many of the packages I use have deprecated
  the behavior that I have been counting on.

  Most annoying is that GGTags has this stupid behavior where it enables itself
  everywhere which screws up the navigation used in Lisp.  I remember that it
  also screws up the navigation used in Eclim, back when I used that.  I enabled
  it for hacking on C/C++ as it is pretty useful there, I think, but it screws
  too much stuff up, so I uninstalled it.

  Magit, as much as I love it, has a developer which is never afraid to break
  things.  Things were broken due to some hook that got added to my Magit config
  long ago.  I needed to remove the hook and it is working again.  Whew...

  Started playing with the Gamekit tutorials.  Have a window there but having
  issues with getting input.

  After getting Trivial-Gamekit setup, I remembered that I had an old idea of a
  game mechanic for a puzzle game called split-shot.  I never really started on
  it, but it seems like the core mechanic could be prototyped during the jam.

  I decided to take part in the 2019 Lisp Game Jam.  Looked at the site and saw
  that there is this game engine called Trivial-Gamekit.  Decided to base it on
  that.  I want to actually finish this, so I'll try to keep the plan
  achievable.
